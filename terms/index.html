      <h2>1. Competitive Restrictions</h2>
      <p>
        Testers are strictly prohibited from competing in certain STARBREAKERS Tournaments hosted by Scriptfall.
        Eligibility is determined on an event-by-event basis to prevent competitive advantage and protect unreleased mechanics.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Confidentiality & Non‑Disclosure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>WIP content is protected under a strict no‑leak policy.</li>
        <li>Sharing screenshots, videos, scripts, or descriptions of internal content is forbidden.</li>
        <li>Any leak results in immediate Permanent Demotion and Blacklist from all Scriptfall projects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Asset Protection & Technical Security</h2>
      <p>
        Any attempt to use third‑party software, exploits, or “Save Instance” commands to extract Scriptfall assets, maps,
        or code is prohibited and will be reported to Roblox.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Intellectual Property & Suggestions</h2>
      <p>
        By participating in testing, any feedback, bug reports, or ideas provided become the exclusive property of Scriptfall.
        Testers waive claims to future compensation, royalties, or ownership over features developed from their input.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention & Security</h2>
      <p>
        We maintain a permanent, non‑requestable record of agreement timestamps and dates, Discord IDs,
        Roblox usernames, and historical account data for security auditing. These records are not eligible for deletion requests.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        ⚠️ FINAL NOTICE: By accepting the Tester role, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these terms.
        Failure to comply results in a total community ban.
